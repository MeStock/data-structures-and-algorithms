# Graph Implementation
Given a graph with the adjacency list as an array, implement a linked list.
Given BFS with an array as the data structure, implement a stack.
Given DFS with an array as the data structure, implement a queue.

## Efficiency
BFS Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of verticies in the graph
BFS Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of verticies in the graph

DFS Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of verticies in the graph
DFS Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of verticies in the graph
