# Reverse an Array
The reverse array function will take in an array as a parameter and return the elements of the array in reverser order.

## Challenge
Moving elements in an array can modify the original array and affect loops. To avoid this, creating a new results array was used.

## Approach & Efficiency
I knew that I needed some sort of looping mechanism, so I started by visualizing the input and output of the array.
    I: [1,2,3,4,5]
    O: [5,4,3,2,1]
This helped me realize that starting at the end of the array would be ideal. Next, I considered my options for how to store the results. I chose to use a new empty array instead of modifying the original. My first solution took 15min to solve.

Similarliy for the stretch goal, I started with a visualization and a new results array. Instead of starting my loop at the end, I used the pop method for arrays. This was a little harder to implement since pop modifies the array, however I stored the original length to overcome this challenge. My second solution took 15min to solve.
